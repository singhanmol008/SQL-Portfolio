# In this sql database, I am querying to create mulitple tables and to add data into those tables.

Create Two Tables: Students and Teachers
The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, homeroom_number, phone,email, and graduation year.

The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.

Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number.

Then insert a teacher names Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) who as a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321.
