# Using sql, I am querying a database which contains data of movies. 

#1   How many films have a rating of R and a replacement cost between $5 and $15?
Select count(title)
from film
where rating = 'R' And replacement_cost Between 5 And 15

#2 How many films have the word Truman somewhere in the title?
select count(title)
from film
Where title like '%Truman%'

# 3   What are the movies in the database that the actor “Woody” have acted in and what year were the movies released?  	

select title, release_year
	from film
	where film_id In
	(select film_id
	from film_actor
	Inner Join actor
 	On film_actor.actor_id = actor.actor_id
 	Where first_name = 'Woody')
 
# 4 Want to Know and compare the various amounts of films we have per movie rating

  select
 sum( 
Case  
 When rating = 'R' Then 1
 Else 0
 End),
  sum( 
Case  
 When rating = 'PG' Then 1
 Else 0
 End),
  sum(
